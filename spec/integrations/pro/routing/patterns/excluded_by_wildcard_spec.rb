# When having a named pattern whose matcher topic name matches a wildcard exclusion, the matcher
# topic should be excluded exactly like a literal exclusion would - proving that wildcard
# include/exclude filters also apply to routing patterns (they are matched against the matcher
# topic name, and later against every dynamically discovered topic name).
