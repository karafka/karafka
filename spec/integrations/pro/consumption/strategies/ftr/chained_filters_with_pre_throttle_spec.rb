# We should be able to chain filters and to achieve expected processing flow
# In this scenario we will filter all odd offsets and we will make sure, we process data with
# a delay and with throttling used to make sure we do not process more than 5 messages per second
# We will throttle first and this will have impact on how many elements we will get into the
# consumer
