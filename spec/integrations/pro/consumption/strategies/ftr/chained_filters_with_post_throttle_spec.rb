# We should be able to chain filters and to achieve expected processing flow
# In this scenario we will filter all odd offsets and we will make sure, we process data with
# a delay and with throttling used to make sure we do not process more than 5 messages per second
# It is important to notice, that the order of filters is important. If we throttle before we
# filter, we will actually always process late because throttling will occur on odd and even.
