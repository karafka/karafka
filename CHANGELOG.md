- #174 - Extended config validation
- ~~#180 - Switch from JSON parser to yajl-ruby~~
- #181 - When responder is defined and not used due to ```respond_with``` not being triggered in the perform, it won't raise an exception.
- #188 - Rename name in config to client id
- #186 - Support ruby-kafka ```ssl_ca_cert_file_path``` config
- #189 - karafka console does not preserve history on exit
- #191 - Karafka 0.6.0rc1 does not work with jruby / now it does :-)
- Switch to multi json so everyone can use their favourite JSON parser
- Added jruby support in general and in Travis
- #196 - Topic mapper does not map topics when subscribing thanks to @webandtech
- #96 - Karafka server - possiblity to run it only for a certain topics
- ~~karafka worker cli option is removed (please use sidekiq directly)~~ - restored, bad idea
- (optional) pausing upon processing failures ```pause_timeout```
- Karafka console main process no longer intercepts irb errors
- Wiki updates
- #204 - Long running controllers
- Better internal API to handle multiple usage cases using ```Karafka::Controllers::Includer```
- #207 - Rename before_enqueued to after_received
- #147 - Deattach Karafka from Sidekiq by extracting Sidekiq backend

### New features and improvements

- batch processing thanks to ```#batch_processing``` flag and ```#params_batch``` on controllers
- ```#topic``` method on an controller instance to make a clear distinction in between params and route details
- Changed routing model (still compatible with 0.5) to allow better resources management
- Lower memory requirements due to object creation limitation (2-3 times less objects on each new message)
- Introduced the ```#batch_processing``` config flag (config for #126) that can be set per each consumer_group
- Added support for partition, offset and partition key in the params hash
- ```name``` option in config renamed to ```client_id```
- Long running controllers with ```persistent``` flag on a topic config level, to make controller instances persistent between messages batches (single controller instance per topic per partition no per messages batch) - turned on by default

### Incompatibilities

- Default boot file is renamed from app.rb to karafka.rb
- Removed worker glass as dependency (now and independent gem)
- ```kafka.hosts``` option renamed to ```kafka.seed_brokers``` - you don't need to provide all the hosts to work with Kafka
- ```start_from_beginning``` moved into kafka scope (```kafka.start_from_beginning```)
- Router no longer checks for route uniqueness - now you can define same routes for multiple kafkas and do a lot of crazy stuff, so it's your responsibility to check uniqueness
- Change in the way we identify topics in between Karafka and Sidekiq workers. If you upgrade, please make sure, all the jobs scheduled in Sidekiq are finished before the upgrade.
- ```batch_mode``` renamed to ```batch_consuming```
- Renamed content to value to better resemble ruby-kafka internal messages naming convention
- When having a responder with ```required``` topics and not using ```#respond_with``` at all, it will raise an exception
- Renamed ```inline_mode``` to ```inline_processing``` to resemble other settings conventions
- Renamed ```inline_processing``` to ```backend``` to reach 1.0 future compatibility
- Single controller **needs** to be used for a single topic consumption
- Renamed ```before_enqueue``` to ```after_received``` to better resemble internal logic, since for inline backend, there is no enqueue.
- Due to the level on which topic and controller are related (class level), the dynamic worker selection is no longer available.
- Renamed params #retrieve to params #retrieve! to better reflect what it does

## 0.1.16
- Cluster level error catching for all exceptions so actor is not killer
