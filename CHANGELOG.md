# Karafka framework changelog

## Current master
- Changed Karafka::Connection::Cluster tp Karafka::Connection::ActorCluster to distinguish between a single thread actor cluster for multiple topic connection and a future feature that will allow process clusterization.

## 0.1.17
 - Add an ability to use user-defined parsers for a messages
 - Lazy load params for before callbacks

## 0.1.16
- Cluster level error catching for all exceptions so actor is not killer
- Cluster level error logging
- Listener refactoring (QueueConsumer extracted)
- Karafka::Connection::QueueConsumer to wrap around fetching logic - technically we could replace Kafka with any other messaging engine as long as we preserve the same API
- Added debug env for debugging purpose in applications
