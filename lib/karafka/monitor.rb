module Karafka
  # Monitor is used to hookup external monitoring services to monitor how Karafka works
  # It provides a standarized API for checking incoming messages/enqueueing etc
  # By default it implements logging functionalities but can be replaced with any more
  #   sophisticated logging/monitoring system like Errbit, Airbrake, NewRelic
  # @note This class acts as a singleton because we are only permitted to have single monitor
  #   per running process (just as logger)
  # Keep in mind, that if you create your own monitor object, you will have to implement also
  # logging functionality (or just inherit, super and do whatever you want)
