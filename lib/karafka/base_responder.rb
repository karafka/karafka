module Karafka
  # Base responder from which all Karafka responders should inherit
  # Similar to Rails responders concept. It allows us to design flow from one app to another
  # by isolating what responses should be sent (and where) based on a given action
  # It differs from Rails responders in the way it works: in std http request we can have one
  # response, here we can have unlimited number of them
  #
  # It has a simple API for defining where should we respond (and if it is required)
  #
  # @example Basic usage (each registered topic is required to be used by default)
  #   class Responder < BaseResponder
  #     topic :new_action
  #
  #     def respond(data)
  #       respond_to :new_action, data
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Responding to a topic with extra options
  #   class Responder < BaseResponder
  #     topic :new_action
  #
  #     def respond(data)
  #       respond_to :new_action, data, partition_key: 'thing'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Marking topic as not required (we won't have to use it)
  #   class Responder < BaseResponder
  #     topic :required_topic
  #     topic :new_action, required: false
  #
  #     def respond(data)
  #       respond_to :required_topic, data
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Multiple times used topic
  #   class Responder < BaseResponder
  #     topic :required_topic, multiple_usage: true
  #
  #     def respond(data)
  #       data.each do |subset|
  #         respond_to :required_topic, subset
  #       end
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Accept multiple arguments to a respond method
  #   class Responder < BaseResponder
  #     topic :users_actions
  #     topic :articles_viewed
  #
  #     def respond(user, article)
  #       respond_to :users_actions, user
  #       respond_to :articles_viewed, article
  #     end
  #   end

    #   UsersCreatedResponder.new(MyParser).call(@created_user)
