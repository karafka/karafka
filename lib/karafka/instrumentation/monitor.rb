    # Monitor is used to hookup external monitoring services to monitor how Karafka works
    # It provides a standardized API for checking incoming messages/enqueueing etc
    # Since it is a pub-sub based on dry-monitor, you can use as many subscribers/loggers at the
    # same time, which means that you might have for example file logging and newrelic at the same
    # time

    #   per running process (just as logger)
