module Karafka
  # Both Karafka and Ruby-Kafka contain a lot of settings that can be applied on multiple
  # levels. In Karafka that is on consumer group and on the topic level. In Ruby-Kafka it
  # is on consumer, subscription and consumption levels. In order to maintain an order
  # in managing those settings, this module was created. It contains details on what setting
  # where should go and which layer (both on Karafka and Ruby-Kafka) is responsible for
  # setting it and sending it forward
  # @note Settings presented here cover all the settings that are being used across Karafka
