module Karafka
  # Base controller from which all Karafka controllers should inherit
  # Similar to Rails controllers we can define after_received callbacks
  # that will be executed
  #
  # Note that if after_received return false, the chain will be stopped and
  #   the perform method won't be executed in sidekiq (won't peform_async it)
  #
  # @example Create simple controller
  #   class ExamplesController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with a block after_received
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     after_received do
  #       # Here we should have some checking logic
  #       # If false is returned, won't schedule a perform action
  #     end
  #
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with a method after_received
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     after_received :after_received_method
  #
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
