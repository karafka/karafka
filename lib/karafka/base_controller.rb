# Karafka module namespace
module Karafka
  # Base controller from which all Karafka controllers should inherit
  # Similar to Rails controllers we can define before_enqueue callbacks
  # that will be executed
  #
  # Note that if before_enqueue return false, the chain will be stopped and
  #   the perform method won't be executed in sidekiq (won't peform_async it)
  #
  # @example Create simple controller
  #   class ExamplesController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with a block before_enqueue
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     before_enqueue do
  #       # Here we should have some checking logic
  #       # If false is returned, won't schedule a perform action
  #     end
  #
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with a method before_enqueue
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     before_enqueue :before_method
  #
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #
  #     private
  #
  #     def before_method
  #       # Here we should have some checking logic
  #       # If false is returned, won't schedule a perform action
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # @example Create a controller with an after_failure action
  #   class ExampleController < Karafka::BaseController
  #     def perform
  #       # some logic here
  #     end
  #
  #     def after_failure
  #       # action taken in case perform fails
  #     end
  #   end

    #   It can be also used when handling really heavy data (in terms of parsing). Without direct
    #   usage outside of worker scope, it will pass raw data into sidekiq, so we won't use Karafka
    #   working time to parse this data. It will happen only in the worker (where it can take time)
    #   that way Karafka will be able to process data really quickly. On the other hand, if we
    #   decide to use params somewhere before it hits worker logic, it won't parse it again in
    #   the worker - it will use already loaded data and pass it to Redis
