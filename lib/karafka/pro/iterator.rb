    # Topic iterator allows you to iterate over topic/partition data and perform lookups for
    # information that you need.
    #
    # It supports early stops on finding the requested data and allows for seeking till
    # the end. It also allows for signaling, when a given message should be last out of certain
    # partition, but we still want to continue iterating in other messages.
    #
    # It does **not** create a consumer group and does not have any offset management.

      # A simple API allowing to iterate over topic/partition data, without having to subscribe
      # and deal with rebalances. This API allows for multi-partition streaming and is optimized
      # for data lookups. It allows for explicit stopping iteration over any partition during
      # the iteration process, allowing for optimized lookups.
      #
      # @param topics [Array<String>, Hash] list of strings if we want to subscribe to multiple
      #   topics and all of their partitions or a hash where keys are the topics and values are
      #   hashes with partitions and their initial offsets.
      # @param settings [Hash] extra settings for the consumer. Please keep in mind, that if
      #   overwritten, you may want to include `auto.offset.reset` to match your case.
      # @param yield_nil [Boolean] should we yield also `nil` values when poll returns nothing.
      #   Useful in particular for long-living iterators.
      #
      # @note It is worth keeping in mind, that this API also needs to operate within
      #   `max.poll.interval.ms` limitations on each iteration
      #
      # @note In case of a never-ending iterator, you need to set `enable.partition.eof` to `false`
      #   so we don't stop polling data even when reaching the end (end on a given moment)
