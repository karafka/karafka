      #
      # This manager takes into consideration the number of partitions assigned to the topics and
      # does its best to balance. Additional connections may not always be utilized because
      # alongside of them, other processes may "hijack" the assignment. In such cases those extra
      # empty connections will be turned off after a while.
      #
      # @note Manager operations relate to consumer groups and not subscription groups. Since
      #   cluster operations can cause consumer group wide effects, we always apply only one
      #   change on a consumer group.
