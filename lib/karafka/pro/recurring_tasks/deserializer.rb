      # Recurring Tasks data deserializer. We compress data ourselves because we cannot rely on
      # any external optional features like certain compression types, etc. By doing this that way
      # we can ensure we have full control over the compression.
      #
      # @note We use `symbolize_names` because we want to use the same convention of hash building
      #   for producing, consuming and displaying related data as in other places.
