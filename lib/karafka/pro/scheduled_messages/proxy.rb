      # Proxy used to wrap the scheduled messages with the correct dispatch envelope.
      # Each message that goes to the scheduler topic needs to have specific headers and other
      # details that are required by the system so we know how and when to dispatch it.
      #
      # Each message that goes to the proxy topic needs to have a unique key. We inject those
      # automatically unless user provides one in an envelope. Since we want to make sure, that
      # the messages dispatched by the user all go to the same partition (if with same key), we
      # inject a partition_key based on the user key or other details if present. That allows us
      # to make sure, that they will always go to the same partition on our side.
      #
      # This wrapper validates the initial message that user wants to send in the future, as well
      # as the envelope and specific requirements for a message to be send in the future
