      # Stores schedules for the current day and gives back those that should be dispatched
      # We do not use min-heap implementation and just a regular hash because we want to be able
      # to update the schedules based on the key as well as remove the schedules in case it would
      # be cancelled. While removals could be implemented, updates with different timestamp would
      # be more complex. At the moment a lookup of 8 640 000 messages (100 per second) takes
      # up to 1.5 second, thus it is acceptable. Please ping me if you encounter performance
      # issues with this naive implementation so it can be improved.
