    class Iterator
      # There are various ways you can provide topics information for iterating.
      #
      # This mapper normalizes this data, resolves offsets and maps the time based offsets into
      # appropriate once
      #
      # Following formats are accepted:
      #
      # - 'topic1' - just a string with one topic name
      # - ['topic1', 'topic2'] - just the names
      # - { 'topic1' => -100 } - names with negative lookup offset
      # - { 'topic1' => { 0 => 5 } } - names with exact partitions offsets
      # - { 'topic1' => { 0 => -5 }, 'topic2' => { 1 => 5 } } - with per partition negative offsets
      # - { 'topic1' => 100 } - means we run all partitions from the offset 100
      # - { 'topic1' => Time.now - 60 } - we run all partitions from the message from 60s ago
      # - { 'topic1' => { 1 => Time.now - 60 } } - partition1 from message 60s ago
      # - { 'topic1' => { 1 => true } } - will pick first offset not consumed on this CG for p 1
      # - { 'topic1' => true } - will pick first offset not consumed on this CG for all p
