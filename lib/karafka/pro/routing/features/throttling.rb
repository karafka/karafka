        # Ability to throttle ingestion of data per topic partition
        # Useful when we have fixed limit of things we can process in a given time period without
        # getting into trouble. It can be used for example to:
        #   - make sure we do not insert things to DB too fast
        #   - make sure we do not dispatch HTTP requests to external resources too fast
