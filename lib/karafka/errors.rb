    #   - you've received a message and we cannot match it with a consumer
    #   - you've changed the routing, so router can no longer associate your topic to
    #     any consumer
    #   - or in a case when you do a lot of meta-programming and you change routing/etc on runtime
    #
    # In case this happens, you will have to create a temporary route that will allow
    # you to "eat" everything from the Sidekiq queue.
    # @see https://github.com/karafka/karafka/issues/135

    # Raised if optional dependencies like karafka-web are required in a version that is not
    # supported by the current framework version or when an optional dependency is missing.
    #
    # Because we do not want to require web out of the box and we do not want to lock web with
