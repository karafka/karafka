    # Executors:
    # - run consumers code (for `#call`) or run given preparation / teardown operations when needed
    #   from separate threads.
    # - they re-create consumer instances in case of partitions that were revoked and assigned
    #   back.
    #
    # @note Executors are not removed after partition is revoked. They are not that big and will
    #   be re-used in case of a re-claim
    #
    # @note Since given consumer can run various operations, executor manages that and its
    #   lifecycle. There are following types of operations with appropriate before/after, etc:
    #
    #   - consume - primary operation related to running user consumption code
    #   - idle - cleanup job that runs on idle runs where no messages would be passed to the end
    #     user. This is used for complex flows with filters, etc
    #   - revoked - runs after the partition was revoked
    #   - shutdown - runs when process is going to shutdown
